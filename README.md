# Code for generating the Phase Mask of a desired pattern

The file contains a Matlab code, `Multiple_Spto.m`, that generates the desired pattern for the phase mask. The phase mask was generated using the Gerchberg Saxton Algorithm on the code `GS_ALgo.m`.  The phase mask is projected onto the spatial light modulator and desired pattern is obtained at the focal plane of the objective. 

While using this code, please keep all the code `.m` files together.
